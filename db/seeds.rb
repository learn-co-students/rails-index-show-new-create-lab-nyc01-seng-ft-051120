# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# coupon1 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "thirteen", store: "Jersey mall")
# coupon2 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "fourteen", store: "NYC store")
# coupon3 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "fifteen", store: "Ice cream store")
# coupon4 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "three", store: "shop")
# coupon5 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "6", store: "Jersey restaurant")
# coupon6 = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "1", store: "scooters")
